# Live-Workspace README

Live-Workspace is an extension for vscode, that provides a workspace for developers/teams who work on a server.

Live-Workspace offers users a "Live" environment, that allows you work on remote files as simply as it would be to work on local files. With Live-Workspace as your editor, managing files on a remote server is not only safe, but also easy.
